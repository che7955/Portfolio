Strawberries, cherries and an angel kissing spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
I walked in town on silver spurs that jingled to
A song that I had only sang to just a few
She saw my silver spurs and said let's pass some time
And I will give to you, summer wine
Oh. oh, oh, summer wine
