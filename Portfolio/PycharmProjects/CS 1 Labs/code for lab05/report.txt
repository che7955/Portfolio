1. What is the purpose of the pivot? Do you really need to choose the middle item
as the pivot? Would the algorithm have behaved differently if you had selected the
first item as the pivot each time?
    the purpose of a pivot is so that we only have to look and compare half of our list
    because the other half is already known to be in either the larger than the pivot or
    smaller or the same and so we don't have to compare each of these pieces as we search.
    you do not need to choose the middle item as the pivot, it can be any item in the list.
    the algorithm would only change in that the pivot point it would compare the lists to would
    be the first elements of each list rather than the middle item.

2. Quickselect is versatile because it can find the kth smallest number. What test cases are
needed to fully exercise quickselect? List several cases that exercise all aspects of the
quickselect function. Remember: a test case identifies specific input values and expected outputs.
    the cases needed to fully test out the quickselect function would be:

    input:
    k 2
    a 10
    t 90
    output: 10

    input:
    o 20
    a 30
    j 40
    e 290
    output: 35

    input:
    k 20
    j 99
    f 44
    u 55
    i 90
    z 12
    output: 49.5

3. What is the elapsed time performance of your quickselect program when it processes
a large data set? (See link below). What is the elapsed time performance of your
median program when it processes the same large data set? Enter the elapsed times
of several runs of each program in your report.
