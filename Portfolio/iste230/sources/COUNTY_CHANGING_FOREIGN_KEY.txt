The alter table command lets you do quite a bit. But when it comes to 
altering existing constraints, there is not much you can do. 
If you want to add an on delete cascade to an existing foreign key 
constraint, you are going to need two statements.

The first statement will drop the constraint and the second 
statement will recreate it with the addition of the on delete 
clause. Furthermore, you’ll want to do this in a transaction 
to ensure the integrity of your data during the transition between indexes.

Here is an example:

ALTER TABLE relative drop FOREIGN KEY
relative_contact_fk;

ALTER TABLE Friend drop FOREIGN KEY
friend_personal_fk;

ALTER TABLE Personal drop FOREIGN KEY
personal_contact_fk;


ALTER TABLE relative ADD 
CONSTRAINT relative_contact_fk FOREIGN KEY (contactID) 
REFERENCES Personal(contactID)
ON DELETE CASCADE
ON UPDATE CASCADE;
-- DELETE of a PERSONAL contact, that is also a RELATIVE, 
-- will cause the RELATIVE record to also be deleted 


ALTER TABLE Friend ADD
CONSTRAINT friend_personal_fk FOREIGN KEY (contactID)
REFERENCES personal(contactID)
ON DELETE CASCADE
ON UPDATE CASCADE;

ALTER TABLE Personal ADD 
CONSTRAINT personal_contact_fk FOREIGN KEY (contactID) 
REFERENCES contact(contactID)
ON DELETE CASCADE
ON UPDATE CASCADE;

-- DELETE of a CONTACT, that is also a PERSONAL contact, will cause the 		PERSONAL record to also be deleted */
-- PERSONAL record to also be deleted */

select contactid, lastname, firstname from 
     contact where contactid = "10011";


START TRANSACTION;     
delete from contact where contactid = "10011";
ROLLBACK;
