<h2>The City</h2>
<img id="histcityimg" src="images/historic.jpg" alt="historical city images">
<p>
    Rochester is a city in the U.S. state of New York, the seat of Monroe County, 
    and the third-most populous in the state after New York City and Buffalo 
    with a population of 211,328 in 2020. The city of Rochester forms the 
    core of a larger metropolitan area with a population of 1 million people, 
    across six counties, which in turn is part of the larger Western New York 
    region that has a population of roughly two million. <span>The city was one of 
    the United States' first boomtowns</span>, initially due to the fertile Genesee 
    River Valley, which gave rise to numerous flour mills, and then as a manufacturing 
    center, which spurred further rapid population growth.

<h2>The State</h2>

<p>
    Native Americans came to the area now called New York about 5,000 years ago. 
    Thousands of years later, their descendants included Native American tribes 
    such as the Mohawk, Cayuga, Oneida, and Seneca. In 1624 the Dutch established 
    a colony on what’s now Manhattan Island called New Amsterdam. It was renamed 
    New York once the British took control of the area in 1664. But after the 
    American Revolution in 1776, New York became a U.S. colony, then a state in 1788. 
    One year later, George Washington was sworn in as the United States’ first 
    president in New York City, then the country’s capital. (It would move to 
    Washington, D.C., the next year, in 1790.)

<h2>A Great Place to Live</h2>

<p>
    A unique blend of natural and man-made resources and amenities give Rochester 
    a quality of life that is second to none. Straddling the Genesee River between 
    the Erie Canal and Lake Ontario, Rochester offers a natural beauty that is easily 
    accessible by a network of parks, trails, boat launches and scenic overlooks. 
    The city is divided into dozens of distinct neighborhoods and urban villages 
    supported by an eclectic mix of stores and restaurants. Quality housing available 
    at reasonable prices, well-paying jobs and a transportation system that minimizes 
    traffic congestion combine with a wide variety of cultural institutions and 
    entertainment options to make Rochester an easy place to enjoy a comfortable 
    work-life balance. The city’s central location in Western New York provides 
    residents a short drive to such destinations as the Niagara Falls, the Finger 
    Lakes region and the Adirondack Mountains. Big cities, including New York, 
    Toronto and Boston are also within a day’s drive.

<h2>A Great Place to Work</h2>
<p>
    Rochester’s economy benefits from many advantages, including an ample 
    supply of fresh water from Lake Ontario and the pristine Finger Lakes, 
    a central location among the population centers of the Northeastern 
    United States and the innovative foundations laid by such firms as Kodak, 
    Xerox and Bausch and Lomb. A host of colleges and universities, 
    including the University of Rochester and the Rochester Institute of 
    Technology, produce an educated workforce and generates cutting-edge 
    research that drives the city’s innovation and technology sectors. 
    Rochester is emerging as the imaging, optics and photonics capital of the
     world and in 2015 the White House announced that new Integrated Photonics 
     Institute for Manufacturing Innovation would be located in Rochester. Other growing
      industries include food-and-beverage manufacturing, biotechnology and green innovation.
